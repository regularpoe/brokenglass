# aura

This program shows you output of current track playing in the cmus. It does that by reading info from 'cmus-remote -Q' command, and parsing this into nicer format.

[todo]

- ~~fix parsing, not showing correctly right now~~
- ~~add desktop notification for some QoL~~
- add config for polling time, maybe some other stuff
- ~~log current playing track into some file~~
